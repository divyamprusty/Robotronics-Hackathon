                    Educable is an organisation founded in the year 2021, which focuses on the education of disabled children. The word "Educable" means "Education for the Disabled", and that's what we aim to be doing. Every person has the right to education in this world, so they shouldn't be deprived of them whatever their situation. Therefore, Educable aims to provide the best possible education available for those with disabilities.

                    The children or their guardian can access our website easily and enroll themselves 
                    to get a teacher of any subject that they are interested in studying or for any 
                    extra-curricular activities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have facilities for the elders with disability that they can become a teacher in our 
                    organisation and can teach the students. It would also be better for the children to learn 
                    from the teacher of their kind because the teacher would be able to explain the child properly.
